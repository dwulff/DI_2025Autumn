In this seminar, there will be two debates following the Lincoln-Douglas format.

## Format

The Lincoln-Douglas format structures a debate of a resolution between an <i>affirmative</i>, which argues in favor of the resolution and a <i>negative</i>, which argues against the resolution. In includes seven steps--four steps for the affirmative and three for the negative--with specific conditions in terms of time and content. The debates in this seminar will implement a team of variant of the Lincoln-Douglas format. In this variant, the debate steps will presented by one (or more) different members of two teams of debaters and there will be 3 minutes time in-between steps for the teams to prepare the next step. At the end of the debate, seminar participants who did not partake in the debate will judge which side delivered the more convincing arguments and thus won the debate.
