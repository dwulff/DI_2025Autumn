## Background
Decision intelligence combines insights from applied data science, behavioral science, and decision science into a unified field that helps people use data to improve their lives, their businesses, and the world around them. Itâ€™s a vital science for the era of AI, teaching the skills needed to competently and responsibly interact with AI. This seminar covers key concepts in decision intelligence, including human bounded rationality, the principles of machine learning, and the ethics of artificial intelligence. Sessions will consist of reviewing and discussing foundational articles on these topics, as well as two debates in which participants argue the two sides of a central question, such as, for instance, whether artificial intelligence will enrich or endanger human life in the long run. The course language is English.

## Goals
Learn about key concepts concerning the intersection of human decision making and artificial intelligence.
